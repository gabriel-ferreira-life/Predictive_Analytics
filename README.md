# Predictive_Analytics

This repository focuses on predictive analytics, which is of very importance for business because it helps decision makers evaluate possible outcomes (e.g., revenues, profits, market share, probability of making a sale, probability of losing a client, etc.) based on other historical data and learning models. Under Dr. Oscar Aguilar guidance, I am seeking to develop my predictive analytics skills to: (1) develop and use advanced predictive analytics methods; (2) develop expertise in the use of popular tools and software for predictive analytics; (3) learn how to develop predictive analytics questions, identify, and select the most appropriate predictive analytics methods and tools, apply these methods to answer the respective. The following topics, in the given order, will covered in this repository:

1. Class Imbalance 2. Multi-class classification 3. Feature engineering 4. Feature selection 5. Hyper-parameter optimization 6. Ensemble learning 7. Xgboost

By doing so, I am developing the following technical-skills: hyper-parameter optimization for classification and regression frameworks, feature selection, feature engineering, cross-validation methods for hyper-parameter tuning and feature selection, and ensemble learning.
